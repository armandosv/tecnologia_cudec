        Cancun is a city in Mexico located on the Yucatan peninsula that borders the Caribbean Sea and is known for its beaches, numerous tourist
         centers, and nightlife. It is made up of 2 distinct areas: the more traditional downtown area and the Hotel Zone, the coastal strip with
          tall hotels, nightclubs, shops and restaurants. Cancun is also a popular destination for students during the spring college vacation period.
