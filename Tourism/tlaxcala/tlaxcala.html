            It was founded on December 9, 1856. It is divided internally into 60 municipalities.14 15 The ancient Tlaxcalans allied with the Spanish to
            defeat the Mexicas, after years of domination by them, so this alliance allowed them remain almost intact throughout the 300-year colonial
            period.16 It was recognized as the federal territory of Mexico in the Constitution of 1824, under the government of Puebla.17 In 1857 it
            became the twenty-second state of the republic. 18 Its territorial administration also changed from municipalities to parties, districts
            and back to municipalities.19 20 Between August and October 1995, sixteen new municipalities were created.

            Most of the state's economy is based on agriculture, light industry, and tourism. The tourism industry is based on the long history of Tlaxcala
            with the main places of interest such as archaeological sites such as Cacaxtla and the colonial buildings in the surroundings of the city of
            Tlaxcala.21
