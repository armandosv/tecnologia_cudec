            Cancun is a city in Mexico located on the Yucatan peninsula that
            borders the Caribbean Sea and is known for its beaches, numerous
            tourist
            centers, and nightlife. It is made up of 2 distinct areas: the more
            traditional downtown area and the Hotel Zone, the coastal strip with
            tall hotels, nightclubs, shops and restaurants. Cancun is also a
            popular destination for students during the spring college vacation
            period.
